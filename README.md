# AGV Robot Server

This repository contains the server-side software for managing communication with the AGV (Automated Guided Vehicle) robots. The server is responsible for handling requests, managing AGV states, and facilitating smooth communication between the AGVs and external systems.

## Features

- **Task Management:** The server can assign tasks to AGV robots, monitor their statuses, and manage ongoing operations.
- **Real-time Communication:** The system supports real-time communication with AGVs, ensuring that commands and data are exchanged without delays.
- **Data Logging:** Important data regarding AGV performance and task execution is logged for analysis.
- **Error Handling:** The server is designed to detect and handle errors effectively, ensuring continuous operation.
- **Scalability:** The server architecture supports scalability, allowing it to manage multiple AGVs simultaneously.

## System Overview

The AGV Robot Server communicates with multiple AGV robots, issuing commands, and receiving status updates. It ensures that all tasks are executed as planned and that AGVs operate safely in their environment.
